This script is intended for use with iDRAC 8 and iLO 5 and has not been tested
with previous iDRAC or iLO versions. Parameters can be set in config.js.
Use NPM to install Node module dependencies:

  npm install -S

Use Node.js to run the script:

  node index.js

The iDRAC and iLO configuration commands are stored in arrays in app/idrac.js
and app/ilo.js.
Individual commands can be commented out with two forward slashes at the
beginning of the line, which will prevent them from being applied.
When configuring newer Dell systems, a micro USB cable can be used to connect
to the iDRAC maintenance port. A virtual interface will be automatically created
and assigned the IP address 169.254.0.3. The management interface can be reached
at 169.254.0.4. This address is independent of the iDRAC NIC and will remain
reachable after the iDRAC IP settings have been configured.
Newer HP systems have an iLO USB-A port which can be used in combination with
a USB NIC for configuration. A static IP (e.g. 169.254.1.3) must be configured
in order to reach the iLO USB interface at 169.254.1.2. As with the iDRAC, the
default iLO address will remain reachable through the USB interface after iLO IP
settings have been applied.
A barcode scanner is helpful when configuring iLOs as each has a unique
password printed on the pull-out tab at the front of the server. The script will
prompt for this password during iLO configuration.

Features to be Implemented in Future Versions
********************************************************************************
- Make the script wait for ping before prompting to push the configuration.
- Handle connection errors.
- Sanitize log files to remove passwords
